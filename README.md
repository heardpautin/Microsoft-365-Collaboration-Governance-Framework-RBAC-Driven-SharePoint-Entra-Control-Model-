# Microsoft 365 Collaboration Governance Framework  
Author: Craig W. Heard  
Focus Area: IAM + GRC + Cloud Collaboration Governance  

---

## 🔎 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how traditional RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) models can be extended into Microsoft 365 collaboration platforms, specifically:

- Microsoft Entra ID (Identity & Group Management)
- SharePoint Online (Collaboration & Resource Authorization)

The framework mirrors a real-world enterprise RBAC matrix and applies it to SharePoint governance, integrating:

- Group-based authorization
- Business ownership enforcement
- Data sensitivity classification
- Access review lifecycle
- Compliance alignment
- Structured site provisioning controls

---

## 🎯 Objective

To design a structured Collaboration Governance Framework that:

- Eliminates direct user permissions
- Enforces group-based access
- Aligns review cadence with risk level
- Controls site creation at inception
- Maps collaboration controls to regulatory frameworks
- Bridges IAM architecture with GRC oversight

## 🏗 Architecture Model

User  
→ Entra Security Group  
→ SharePoint Role (Owner / Member / Visitor)  
→ Governance Controls  
→ Access Review Lifecycle  

Identity = Authentication  
SharePoint = Resource Authorization  
Governance = Oversight & Compliance Enforcement

Governance Layer

• Access Reviews (Scheduled Certification)
• Guest Expiration Policies

• DLP Enforcement
• Site Expiration Policy

Compliance / Audit Layer
------------------------
• Audit Logs
• Access Review Evidence
• Policy Documentation
• Control Mapping (SOX / HIPAA / NIST / ISO)

Flow Summary:
User → Identity → Group → Role → Resource → Governance Controls → Audit Evidence → Compliance Alignment

## 🏗 Site Provisioning & Approval Workflow

Effective collaboration governance begins at the point of site creation.  
This framework enforces structured controls during provisioning to prevent unmanaged sprawl and entitlement risk.

### 1️⃣ Site Request Initiation

• Request submitted via standardized intake form (ServiceNow / M365 Request Form)  
• Business justification required  
• Data sensitivity classification selected (Public / Internal / Confidential / Restricted)  
• Primary Business Owner identified  
• Secondary Owner required for redundancy  

---

### 2️⃣ Governance Validation

Before site creation:

• Business Owner validated (must be non-IT data owner)  
• Sensitivity classification reviewed  
• External sharing requirements declared  
• Compliance mapping identified (if applicable)  

High-sensitivity sites require governance approval prior to creation.

---

### 3️⃣ Automated Provisioning Controls

Upon approval:

• Microsoft 365 Group automatically created  
• Entra Security Group aligned to business role  
• SharePoint site provisioned with standardized template  
• Default permission roles applied (Owner / Member / Visitor)  
• Sensitivity label automatically enforced  
• External sharing policy configured based on classification  
• Site expiration policy applied  

No direct user permissions are permitted at creation.

---

### 4️⃣ Lifecycle Controls Applied

Immediately after provisioning:

• Access Review schedule assigned based on sensitivity level  
• Guest access expiration policy enforced (if enabled)  
• Audit logging enabled  
• DLP policies inherited from classification tier  
• Site ownership recorded for audit traceability  

---

### 5️⃣ Ongoing Governance Enforcement

• Quarterly or semi-annual access certification (risk-based)  
• Automatic notification of inactive sites  
• Owner attestation required for renewal  
• Automatic archival or deletion if lifecycle policy not satisfied  

---

### Governance Objective

Provisioning is treated as a control event — not a convenience action.

This structured provisioning model ensures:

• Least privilege from inception  
• Business accountability  
• Elimination of unmanaged site creation  
• Reduced data sprawl risk  
• Alignment with Zero Trust principles  
• Audit-ready evidence trail

## 📊 Core Components

### 1️⃣ Collaboration Governance Matrix (CSV)

Defines structured mapping between:

- Business Unit
- Job Role
- Entra Group
- SharePoint Site
- Permission Role
- Data Sensitivity
- External Sharing Policy
- Access Review Frequency
- Business Owner
- Compliance Framework Mapping

### 2️⃣ Governance Principles

- No direct user permission assignments
- Standardized permission roles (Owner / Member / Visitor)
- Mandatory business ownership of collaboration sites
- Guest access expiration and oversight
- Sensitivity-driven policy enforcement
- Permission inheritance preserved wherever possible

---

## 🛡 Risk & Compliance Integration

Controls are aligned to commonly recognized regulatory and security frameworks including:

- SOX 404
- HIPAA
- FFIEC
- NIST AC-2
- ISO 27001

This demonstrates how collaboration platforms can transition from unmanaged data repositories to structured, auditable environments.

---

## 📈 Governance Maturity Model

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Level 1 | Ad-hoc permissions, direct user assignments, no review cycle |
| Level 2 | Group-based access with partial review and limited oversight |
| Level 3 | Structured matrix, lifecycle automation, compliance mapping, standardized roles |

This project models a Level 3 governance design.

## 🧠 Key Architectural Insight

Most SharePoint governance issues are not authentication failures — they are entitlement lifecycle and governance maturity gaps.

Microsoft Entra ID handles identity and authentication.  
SharePoint handles resource-level authorization.  
Governance ensures structured oversight and lifecycle enforcement across both layers.

---

## 🏛 Federal / Regulatory Alignment Statement

This framework demonstrates governance maturity aligned to both financial regulatory expectations and federal RMF principles by integrating identity-based access control, least privilege enforcement, and structured entitlement review within cloud collaboration environments.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Dynamic group logic (attribute-based access control)
- Sensitivity label enforcement mapping
- Data Loss Prevention (DLP) integration model
- Risk scoring model for entitlement exposure
- Automated provisioning workflow integration example

## 💼 Professional Application

This framework demonstrates the ability to:

- Translate IAM principles into collaboration governance
- Design structured entitlement lifecycle controls
- Align technical authorization models with compliance requirements
- Apply GRC discipline to cloud-based collaboration platforms
- Architect lifecycle-based access control models in Microsoft 365 environments

This project reflects practical enterprise governance thinking applicable to financial services, healthcare, and federal environments.
